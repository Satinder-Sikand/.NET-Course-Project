# .NET Course Project

This project was created by following the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pi46L7UYP8I.


## Description

I made this project by following a freecodecamp course by Bhrugen Patel. It's main purpose is just to refresh myself on C# and learn and become more comfortable with .NET for CRUD purposes. I updated the code from .NET 5 to .NET 6 and added a little bit of a new feature to make some use out of the DisplayOrder attribute that was made (since it was just sitting there doing nothing in the tutorial). I plan to use the knowledge gained from this to make a larger application that can be used.
